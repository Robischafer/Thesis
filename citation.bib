We use a Markov regime-switching dynamic correlation, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity ({MS}-{DCC}-{GARCH}) model in order to capture the time variations and structural breaks in the spillovers. We further evaluate the optimal weights, hedging effectiveness, and dynamic hedging strategies for the {MS}-{DCC}-{GARCH} model based on both the regime-dependent and regime-independent optimal hedge ratios. We ﬁnally complement our analysis by examining the in- and out-of sample hedging performances for alternative strategies. Our results mainly show signiﬁcant volatility and time-varying risk transmission from energy markets to carbon market. We also ﬁnd that spot and futures segments of the emission markets exhibit timevarying correlations and volatile hedging effectiveness. The subsample estimates show signiﬁcant changes in the hedge effectiveness over the different phases of the European carbon market. These results have important investment and policy implications.},

	abstract = {We propose a theory in which each stock’s environmental, social, and governance ({ESG}) score plays two roles: 1) providing information about firm fundamentals and 2) affecting investor preferences. The solution to the investor’s portfolio problem is characterized by an {ESG}-efficient frontier, showing the highest attainable Sharpe ratio for each {ESG} level. The corresponding portfolios satisfy four-fund separation. Equilibrium asset prices are determined by an {ESG}-adjusted capital asset pricing model, showing when {ESG} increases or lowers the required return. Combining several large data sets, we compute the empirical {ESG}-efficient frontier and show the costs and benefits of responsible investing. Finally, we test our theory’s predictions using proxies for E (carbon emissions), S, G, and overall {ESG}.},

Our findings suggest that none of the three carbon futures contracts examined here are priced according to the cost-of-carry model, although two of the three contracts form a stable long-run relationship with the spot price and interest rates, and hence act as adequate risk mitigation instruments. In terms of information diffusion between the futures and spot contracts, it appears that the spot and futures markets share information efficiently and contribute to price discovery jointly. However, our analysis suggests that the predominant source of information spillovers appears to be the sign or direction of price change, i.e. return spillover, rather than the magnitude of price change, i.e. volatility spillover.},

By using variables which possess forecast power for equity and commodity returns, we document that carbon futures returns may be weakly forecast on the basis of two variables from the stock and bond markets, i.e. equity dividend yields and the “junk bond” premium. Our results also suggest that the forecast abilities of two variables related to interest rates variation and economic trends on global commodity markets, respectively the U.S. Treasury bill yields and the excess return on the Reuters/{CRB} Index, are not robust on the carbon market. This latter result reinforces the belief that the {EU} {ETS} is currently operating as a very speciﬁc commodity market, with distinct fundamentals linked to allowance supply and power demand. The sensitivity of carbon futures to macroeconomic inﬂuences is carefully identiﬁed following a sub-sample decomposition before and after August 2007, which attempts to take into account the potential impact of the “credit crunch” crisis. Collectively, these results challenge the market observers' viewpoint that carbon futures prices are immediately correlated with changes in the macroeconomic environment, and rather suggest that the carbon market is only remotely connected to macroeconomic variables. The economic logic behind these results may be related to the fuel-switching behavior of power producers in inﬂuencing primarily carbon futures price changes.},

	abstract = {This study examines carbon spot and futures price relationships and the dynamics of the carbon term structure in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme ({ETS}) between 2005-2014. Using spot and futures prices, we calculate an implied cost of carry. According to received theory, the cost of carry is—with some exceptions—just the opportunity cost of money, so that the term structure of the cost of carry should exactly equal the term structure interest rates. However, we show that spot carbon allowances were originally expensive relative to futures, but since late 2008 the situation reversed and spot carbon allowances have been persistently cheap relative to futures prices. This dramatic shift coincides with the onset of the global financial crisis in late 2008 and the ongoing European banking crisis of 2010-2013.},

We ﬁnd that {ESG} scores include valuable information about the downside risk of ﬁrms. This eﬀect is particularly salient for the ﬁrms with high information asymmetry such as small ﬁrms. Interestingly, of the three {ESG} criteria, only environmental scores show a signiﬁcant impact on bond returns when interacted with the ﬁrm size, suggesting that high environmental scores lower the cost of debt ﬁnancing for small ﬁrms. Finally, {ESG} is complementary to credit ratings in assessing credit quality as credit ratings cannot explain away {ESG} eﬀects in predicting future bond returns. This result suggests that credit rating agencies should either integrate {ESG} scores into their current rating process or produce separate {ESG} scores which bond investors integrate with the existing credit ratings by themselves.},

We hypothesize that there is a societal norm against funding operations that promote vice and that some investors, particularly institutions subject to norms, pay a ﬁnancial cost in abstaining from these stocks. Consistent with this hypothesis, we ﬁnd that sin stocks are less held by norm-constrained institutions such as pension plans as compared to mutual or hedge funds that are natural arbitrageurs, and they receive less coverage from analysts than do stocks of otherwise comparable characteristics. Sin stocks also have higher expected returns than otherwise comparable stocks, consistent with them being neglected by norm-constrained investors and facing greater litigation risk heightened by social norms. Evidence from corporate ﬁnancing decisions and the performance of sin stocks outside the {US} also suggest that norms affect stock prices and returns.},

	abstract = {The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ({EU} {ETS}) is supposed to be an important mechanism for addressing climate change. Up to now, the theoretical foundation of {EU} {ETS} has been widely acknowledged, but empirical research on its current situation has only been published recently or is forthcoming. Therefore, this paper is aimed to summarize the main arguments of empirical studies on the {EU} {ETS}, in terms of two aspects, i.e., the operating mechanism and economic effect of the {EU} {ETS}, which are two crucial topics and have been attached much attention. Based on the shortcomings of current research and future requirements of the {EU} {ETS} evolution, ﬁnally, we also present some further directions of the {EU} {ETS} research. Overall, the research overview here may be helpful to recognize the features of the {EU} {ETS} and its effect on others.},

	title = {Assessing the effectiveness of the {EU} Emissions Trading System},
	abstract = {As an increasing number of countries, regions, cities and states implement emissions trading policies to limit {CO}2 emission, many turn to the experience of the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme, the largest greenhouse gas emissions trading system in operation. The aim of this paper is to survey the body of literature developed over the past eight years of the scheme’s existence, particularly those focusing on three key challenging areas of evaluation: (1) emissions abatement in relation to the balance with economic objectives; (2) investment and innovation impacts; and (3) profits and price impacts. Among the key conclusions is that the lack of flexibility in the structure of the {EU} {ETS} cap, and its inability to adjust to radically altered wider economic conditions in the shape of the financial crisis, threatens to undermine its efficacy in providing incentives for abatement.},
